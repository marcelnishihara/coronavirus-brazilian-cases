## What is Cloud Function After All

According to [Google Cloud webpage](https://cloud.google.com/functions), _Cloud Functions is Google Cloudâ€™s event-driven serverless compute platform. Run your code locally or in the cloud without having to provision servers. Go from code to deploy with continuous delivery and monitoring tools. Cloud Functions scales up or down, so you pay only for compute resources you use. Easily create end-to-end complex development scenarios by connecting with existing Google Cloud or third-party services._
